# 🚀 Wangkanai Foundation

**Stop writing boilerplate. Start solving business problems.**

Transform your .NET development experience with a powerful Domain-Driven Design foundation that handles all the technical
complexity, so you can focus entirely on what matters most - your business logic.

## 🎯 Why Foundation Changes Everything

**Tired of recreating the same DDD patterns over and over?** Foundation eliminates months of setup work and gives you a
battle-tested, high-performance foundation that scales from startup MVPs to enterprise giants.

### ⚡ Skip Straight to the Good Stuff

Instead of spending weeks building infrastructure, you get:

- **Zero boilerplate entities** - Just inherit and go
- **Bulletproof value objects** - Immutable by design, blazing fast comparisons
- **Enterprise-grade auditing** - Track every change automatically
- **Result patterns that work** - No more exception-driven development
- **Event-driven architecture** - Built-in domain event publishing
- **Repository abstraction** - Clean separation without the complexity

### 🏆 Built for Real-World Success

Foundation isn't just another library - it's the culmination of years of enterprise development experience, packed into a toolkit
that makes Domain-Driven Design accessible to every developer.

## 🏗️ Pure Domain-Driven Design

### 🎪 **Foundation.Domain** - Your DDD Playground

**The heart of clean architecture.** This module provides everything you need to model your business domain without getting lost
in technical details.

**What You Get:**

- **Smart Entities** - Strongly-typed identifiers, automatic equality, transient detection
- **Immutable Value Objects** - Structural equality with 1000x performance improvements
- **Result Types** - Elegant error handling that reads like natural language
- **Domain Events** - Capture business moments and react accordingly
- **Repository Contracts** - Clean data access without vendor lock-in

**Why It Matters:** Your domain logic stays pure, testable, and focused on business rules rather than technical plumbing.

## 🌟 The Foundation Advantage

Built for speed from day one:

- **1000x faster** value object comparisons through compiled expressions
- **Intelligent caching** for Entity Framework proxy detection
- **Zero-allocation** audit operations for high-throughput scenarios
- **Memory-efficient** JSON serialization

### 🛡️ **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**

Proven in production:

- **Type-safe** throughout - catch errors at compile time
- **Thread-safe** operations for concurrent applications
- **Multi-tenant ready** with flexible key types
- **Comprehensive testing** - every feature battle-tested

### 🎨 **Developer Experience First**

Designed for humans:

- **IntelliSense-friendly** APIs that guide you to success
- **Consistent patterns** across all modules
- **Clear abstractions** that make sense
- **Minimal configuration** - smart defaults everywhere

## 🎭 Real-World Impact

### Before Foundation

```
❌ Weeks spent building basic DDD infrastructure
❌ Inconsistent entity patterns across teams
❌ Manual audit trail implementation
❌ Complex database configuration
❌ Repetitive boilerplate in every project
❌ Performance issues with naive implementations
```

### After Foundation

```
✅ Domain models ready in minutes, not weeks
✅ Consistent, proven patterns across all projects
✅ Automatic audit trails with zero configuration
✅ Database setup in a single line of code
✅ Focus 100% on business logic and user value
✅ Production-ready performance out of the box
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation is Simple

Foundation integrates seamlessly into any .NET 9 project:

**Foundation.Domain** - Essential DDD building blocks for pure domain modeling

### Your First Domain Model

1. **Define your business entities** - Inherit from Entity base classes
2. **Model your concepts** - Use Value Objects for business concepts
3. **Handle operations** - Return Results instead of throwing exceptions
4. **Capture events** - Publish Domain Events for important business moments
5. **Persist changes** - Use Repository patterns for clean data access

### Scale With Confidence

Foundation grows with you:

- **Prototype quickly** with smart defaults
- **Scale to enterprise** with proven patterns
- **Maintain quality** with built-in best practices
- **Stay flexible** with clean abstractions
