/// The unit-of-work pattern ensures atomicity and consistency by encapsulating a set of operations that can be committed together.

/// Defines an asynchronous variant of the unit-of-work pattern that provides mechanisms for managing data modifications and

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The asynchronous unit-of-work pattern extends the traditional unit-of-work by incorporating asynchronous operations,
/// enabling more efficient handling of I/O-bound data operations.
/// This interface is designed to support scenarios where tasks, such as saving changes,
/// need to be performed asynchronously to improve responsiveness and scalability.
