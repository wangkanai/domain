# 🗄️ Wangkanai EntityFramework

**Database configuration shouldn't take days. It should take minutes.**

Supercharge your Entity Framework Core experience with powerful extensions that eliminate database setup complexity, automate
tedious configurations, and let you focus on your domain models instead of infrastructure code.

## 🎯 Why EntityFramework Module Matters

**Stop fighting with database configuration.** Start building features that matter. This module transforms Entity Framework Core
from a powerful-but-complex ORM into a delightful development experience.

### ⚡ The Database Pain Points

Every EF Core project faces the same challenges:

- Complex migration setup and management
- Repetitive database initialization code
- Manual timestamp configuration for audit fields
- Database-specific quirks and configurations
- Boilerplate code for common patterns
- Context configuration ceremony

### 🏆 The EntityFramework Solution

Our module delivers database productivity that:

- **Works instantly** - One-line setup for complex operations
- **Supports everything** - PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server out of the box
- **Automates tedium** - Smart defaults for common patterns
- **Scales naturally** - From development to production seamlessly

## 🎪 What Makes EntityFramework Module Special
